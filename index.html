            <p id="intro-description">These porcelains from the collections of the Freer Gallery are part of a
                1,500-year-old tradition of
                making porcelains in Jingdezhen, China. Porcelain production during the Kangxi period (1662–1722)
                expanded China’s export trade with Europe, sparked the Chinamania craze in the nineteenth century, and
                bolstered the East-West exchange that endures to this day.</p>

                    <p>
                        The sources describe an incense burner made from porcelain with minute grayish impurities. [1]
                        It has a white glaze with a slight bluish tinge. [1] The glaze has numerous pittings inside the
                        incense burner and on the base. [1]

                    <h3>Bottle-shaped porcelain vase</h3>
                    <p>This document details a bottle-shaped porcelain vase, part of a pair, from the Freer Gallery of
                        Art collection. Key features include its pear shape, long neck, and underglaze cobalt blue
                        decoration depicting rockeries, flowering plants, and floral scrolls. The vase's provenance is
                        meticulously traced, from its creation in Jingdezhen, China during the Qing dynasty (1662-1722),
                        through ownership by George Eumorfopoulos, to its eventual donation by Myron and Pauline Falk in
                        1982. The record provides detailed information including dimensions, materials, and digital
                        access information.</p>

                    <h3>Mountains & Lakes</h3>
                    <p>This document details the metadata for a Chinese porcelain vase from the Freer Gallery of Art and
                        Arthur M. Sackler Gallery collection. The vase, a tall cylindrical piece with a blue and white
                        glaze depicting a mountain and lake scene, dates back to the Qing dynasty (circa 1700) and
                        originates from Jingdezhen, China. Donated by Mrs. Julia Curtis in 1991, the record includes its
                        dimensions, materials (porcelain with cobalt pigment), provenance, and usage restrictions, along
                        with links to related online resources and its unique identifier. The overall purpose is to
                        provide a comprehensive digital record of the vase's history and attributes.

                    <h3>3rd Image</h3>
                    <p>This document details the provenance of a beaker-shaped porcelain vase, part of a five-piece
                        garniture, now held in the Freer Gallery of Art. The vase's journey, from its creation during
                        the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) in Jingdezhen, China, is meticulously traced through various
                        owners, including the Duveen Brothers, Mrs. B.F. Jones Jr., and the Falk family, culminating in
                        its 1980 donation to the museum. The text highlights the vase's artistic significance,
                        describing its blue-and-white decoration depicting court scenes and herringbone borders, and its
                        historical importance, evidenced by detailed records of its sale and acquisition, including
                        auction catalogues and invoices. Ultimately, the document serves as a comprehensive record of
                        ownership and artistic description for this significant piece of Chinese porcelain.

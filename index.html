                making porcelains in Jingdezhen, China. Porcelain production during the Kangxi period (1662–1722)
                expanded China’s export trade with Europe, sparked the Chinamania craze in the nineteenth century, and
                bolstered the East-West exchange that endures to this day.</p>

                    <p>
                        The sources describe an incense burner made from porcelain with minute grayish impurities. [1]
                        It has a white glaze with a slight bluish tinge. [1] The glaze has numerous pittings inside the
                        incense burner and on the base. [1]

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Decoration:</b>


                        The outside is decorated with a continuous landscape in underglaze blue. [1]
                        The landscape includes rocks, trees, water, figures, boats and pavilions. [1]
                        The design is mainly executed in outline and wash, with the water depicted in parallel
                        horizontal lines typical of the Kangxi period. [1, 2]
                        Around the neck of the incense burner is a band of motifs alternating with a cloud scroll. [2]
                        The motifs include five of the Eight Precious Things. [2]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Shape:</b>

                        Round shape with bulging sides. [1]
                        Contracted neck and flaring rim. [1]
                        Low foot trimmed above the rim on the outside. [1]
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Origin and History:</b>

                        The incense burner is from the late 17th century, during the Qing dynasty. [2, 3]
                        It was made in Jingdezhen, in the Jiangxi province of China. [3]
                        Before 1975, the incense burner was part of a New York State estate. [2]
                        It was then purchased at an estate sale in 1975 by a private collector in Washington, DC. [2, 3]
                        The Freer Gallery of Art received the incense burner as a gift from the private collector in
                        1978. [2]

                        <b>3D Model:</b>

                        As discussed previously, a 3D model of this incense burner is available, but the sources do not
                        provide any further details about the model.

                        Medium: Porcelain with cobalt pigment under a clear glaze. [4]
                        Style: Jingdezhen ware. [4]

                    <h3>1st Image: bottle-shaped porcelain vase</h3>
                    <p>This document details a bottle-shaped porcelain vase, part of a pair, from the Freer Gallery of
                        Art collection. Key features include its pear shape, long neck, and underglaze cobalt blue
                        decoration depicting rockeries, flowering plants, and floral scrolls. The vase's provenance is
                        meticulously traced, from its creation in Jingdezhen, China during the Qing dynasty (1662-1722),
                        through ownership by George Eumorfopoulos, to its eventual donation by Myron and Pauline Falk in
                        1982. The record provides detailed information including dimensions, materials, and digital
                        access information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Cobalt Blue Designs in Jingdezhen Ware</h3>
                    <p>The sources, which are museum records of Chinese porcelain objects, frequently mention the use of
                        cobalt blue decoration on Jingdezhen ware. The descriptions provide insights into how this
                        distinctive colour was employed in the designs:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Underglaze Application: The cobalt pigment was applied under the glaze, as seen in the
                            descriptions
                            of the beaker-shaped vase, bottle-shaped vase, and incense burner. This technique involves
                            painting
                            the design onto the unglazed porcelain body before it is coated with a clear glaze and
                            fired.
                            The
                            result is a durable and vibrant blue decoration protected beneath the glaze.</li>
                        <li>
                            Landscapes and Motifs: The incense burner's description reveals how cobalt blue was used to
                            depict
                            detailed landscape scenes. These scenes included elements such as rocks, trees, water,
                            figures,
                            boats, and pavilions. Additionally, the beaker-shaped vase features a court scene,
                            indicating
                            that
                            cobalt blue was also used to portray figures and narratives.</li>
                        <li>
                            Stylistic Conventions: The incense burner's description highlights the use of parallel
                            horizontal
                            lines to represent water, a technique typical of the Kangxi period. This suggests that
                            specific
                            stylistic conventions were followed in applying the cobalt blue designs during different
                            periods.</li>
                        <li>
                            Bands and Borders: Cobalt blue was also used to create decorative bands and borders. The
                            incense
                            burner features a band around its neck composed of five of the Eight Precious Things
                            alternating
                            with cloud scrolls. The beaker-shaped vase incorporates herringbone borders to divide
                            different
                            sections of its decoration.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Further Exploration:</h3>
                        <p>While the sources offer glimpses into the use of cobalt blue designs on Jingdezhen ware, they
                            do
                            not
                            provide an exhaustive analysis of this aspect. To explore this topic further, it would be
                            beneficial
                            to consult additional resources such as:</p>

                                understanding of
                                the

                    <p>This document details the metadata for a Chinese porcelain vase from the Freer Gallery of Art and
                        Arthur M. Sackler Gallery collection. The vase, a tall cylindrical piece with a blue and white
                        glaze depicting a mountain and lake scene, dates back to the Qing dynasty (circa 1700) and
                        originates from Jingdezhen, China. Donated by Mrs. Julia Curtis in 1991, the record includes its
                        dimensions, materials (porcelain with cobalt pigment), provenance, and usage restrictions, along
                        with links to related online resources and its unique identifier. The overall purpose is to
                        provide a comprehensive digital record of the vase's history and attributes.

                    <h3>3rd Image</h3>
                    <p>This document details the provenance of a beaker-shaped porcelain vase, part of a five-piece
                        garniture, now held in the Freer Gallery of Art. The vase's journey, from its creation during
                        the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) in Jingdezhen, China, is meticulously traced through various
                        owners, including the Duveen Brothers, Mrs. B.F. Jones Jr., and the Falk family, culminating in
                        its 1980 donation to the museum. The text highlights the vase's artistic significance,
                        describing its blue-and-white decoration depicting court scenes and herringbone borders, and its
                        historical importance, evidenced by detailed records of its sale and acquisition, including
                        auction catalogues and invoices. Ultimately, the document serves as a comprehensive record of
                        ownership and artistic description for this significant piece of Chinese porcelain.
